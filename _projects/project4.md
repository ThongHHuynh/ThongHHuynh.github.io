As a **Research Assistant** at **MARS Lab**, I worked on a **legged multi-modal robot** capable of both walking and flying. This robot was designed and tested entirely in simulation to explore advanced mobility strategies in robotics.

The robot features:
- **Legged locomotion**: Enables it to walk and maneuver on uneven terrain using inverse kinematics and gait control
- **Flight mode**: Controlled using **PX4** flight stack with MAVROS integration, enabling vertical takeoff and transition between modes

The simulation was built using:
- **URDF** and **Gazebo** for physics and sensor emulation
- **ROS1** for control logic and state estimation
- **PX4 SITL** for realistic drone dynamics and offboard flight testing

Key focus areas included:
- Multi-sensor fusion (IMU + LiDAR)
- Stability during mode transitions
- Gait control and body pose adjustments

This research supports the development of adaptive robots for complex environments such as search and rescue or exploration.

Below are snapshots from the simulation:
