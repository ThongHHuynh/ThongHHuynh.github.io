As a **Research Assistant** at **MARS Lab**, I worked on a **legged multi-modal robot** capable of both walking and flying. This robot was designed and tested entirely in simulation to explore advanced mobility strategies in robotics.

The simulation was built using:
- **Gazebo** for physics and sensor emulation
- **ROS1** 
- **PX4 SITL** for realistic drone control and offboard flight testing


Below are snapshots from the simulation:
