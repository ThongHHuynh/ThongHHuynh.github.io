As a **Research Assistant** at **MARS Lab**, I worked on simulating a multi-modal robot capable of both terrestrial and aerial mobility.

This robot integrates two modes:
- **Walking**, using a legged mechanism for precise ground traversal.
- **Flying**, using PX4 and MAVROS for stable drone dynamics in Gazebo.

The full pipeline was built in **ROS1**, with Gazebo used for physics simulation, joint control, and sensor integration. I explored stability and transition behaviors between modes, as well as multi-sensor fusion using IMU, lidar, and depth vision.

This work laid the foundation for future hybrid navigation systems and autonomous control.

Below are some visuals from the simulation:
