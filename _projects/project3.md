This project involves the development and simulation of a **6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) robotic arm**, focusing on joint kinematics, control, and motion planning.

The robotic arm was modeled in **SolidWorks**, exported into **URDF**, and simulated in **Gazebo** under the **ROS1** ecosystem. Each joint was assigned accurate limits and control parameters, enabling realistic motion profiles.

Key goals of the project:
- Implement joint-space control and forward kinematics
- Simulate pick-and-place movements

This work forms the basis for robotic manipulation tasks such as sorting, object grasping, and automated assembly.

Below are snapshots from the simulation and model testing:
