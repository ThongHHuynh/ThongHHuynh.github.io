This project involves the development and simulation of a **6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) robotic arm**, focusing on joint kinematics, control, and motion planning.

The robotic arm was modeled in **SolidWorks**, exported into **URDF**, and simulated in **RVIZ**. 

Key goals of the project:
- Self-taught about Inverse Kinematics and Forward Kinematics 
- Simulate pick-and-place movements

This work forms the basis for robotic manipulation tasks such as sorting, object grasping, and automated assembly.

Below are snapshots from the simulation and model testing:
