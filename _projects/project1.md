**Bolt Eye** is a modular, automated system designed for real-time detection and quality control of bolts and nuts.  
It utilizes a custom-built 3D printed conveyor, integrated with an Intel RealSense D455i and a MIPI camera for high-precision visual inspection.

The system detects, classifies, counts, and measures fasteners using a combination of YOLO-based object detection and Mask R-CNN for segmentation. The end goal is to accurately identify flaws, especially in threads and head geometry.

I am currently improving the thread masking algorithm to enhance flaw detection accuracy on threaded surfaces.

Below are some images while testing and implementing
